This folder contains exemplary Python codes for a simple MPI reconstruction.

## Before you start

The data (`systemMatrix.h5` and `measurement_5.h5`) provided [here] (http://www.tuhh.de/ibi/research/mpi-data-format.html)  have to be placed in the `MDF` folder and the downloaded File `measurement_5.h5` has to be renamed to `measurement.h5`

In order to run this example code a Python distribution including the Numpy and 
Matplotlib package have to be installed (e.g. the Anaconda Python distribution)

## Runing the example

To run the script one has to start 

  ipython --pylab
